#WSO2 Governance Registry

The WSO2 Governance Registry is a Registry and a Repository available under the
Apache Software License v2.0 which provides the right level of structure
straight out of the box to support SOA Governance, configuration governance,
development process governance, design and run-time governance, lifecycle
management, and team collaboration in a web-friendly and community-enabled
way. It was built with enterprise metadata for SOA in mind, but really
it's up to you - the WSO2 Governance Registry can hold any kind of "stuff" including
images, service descriptions, text files, office documents... and every 
resource you put in the WSO2 Governance Registry becomes a center for social activity.

Eschewing the complexity (and WS-* focus) of specs like UDDI, our 
WSO2 Governance Registry uses the Atom Publishing Protocol (via Apache Abdera) to offer 
a standard and RESTful simple remote interface, which can be accessed
easily by custom code, feed readers, and even browsers.

The WSO2 Governance Registry has been designed both to encourage "grass-roots" community 
around your data and also to allow for IT-friendly governance.  A full 
feature list follows. We hope you'll find many uses for it, and that 
you'll share them with us as we work to make it even better!
