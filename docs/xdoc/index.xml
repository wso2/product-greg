        <p/>
        <p>
            The @product.name@ is a hub for managing data in a web-friendly and
            community-enabled way.  It was built with enterprise metadata for SOA in
            mind, but really it's up to you - the @product.name@ can hold any kind of
            "stuff" including images, service descriptions, text files, office
            documents... and every resource you put in the @product.name@ becomes a center
            for social activity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Eschewing the complexity (and WS-* focus) of specs like UDDI, our
            @product.name@ uses the Atom Publishing Protocol (via Apache Abdera) to offer
            a standard and a simple RESTful remote interface, which can be accessed
            easily by custom code, feed readers, and browsers.
        </p>

        <p>
            The @product.name@ has been designed both to encourage "grass-roots" community
            around your data and also to allow for IT-friendly governance.  A full
            feature list follows. We hope you'll find many uses for it, and that
            you'll share them with us as we work to make it even better!
        </p>

        <p>
            The @product.name@ is available under the
            <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache Software License v2.0</a>,
            and can be either used as a complete product or used in combination with components of
            other WSO2 products. User specific components, extensions or UIs to the Registry can be
            easily added as Carbon components.</p>
