ESB Governance Model
=======================

This consists of three types of ESB asset models of WSO2 ESB. 

1. Proxy
2. Sequnce
3. Endpoint

The correlation between these asset models is exactly same as in WSO2 ESB. This model has been introduced to provide ability to govern ESB artifacts like proxy services, and points, sequences and etc. 

Populate the model
==================
You can populate the model by executing ant run-esb command inside $CARBON_HOME/samples/asset_models/Populator directory.
